# Distributed

Hello! You can find me at IP:port

## Install deps

To start you should install these deps.

 - `npm install my-local-ip optimist message-stream stream-serializer --no-reg`

## The boilerplate

To make things easy we wrote a boilerplate for you.

Go grab it from IP:port/boilerplate

## Ready set go!

You've got the deps, you've got the code. You can run the code

for client mode call me like
`node chat.js --name=MY_NAME --port=8000 --host=10.0.1.30`

for server mode call me like
`node chat.js --name=MY_SERVER_NAME --server=MY_PORT`

You can talk to yourself in either client or server mode. If
    you run in client mode whatever host/port your trying to
    connect to should be up.

## OOPS, something went wrong?

    @hijinx will come round and help you figure it out!

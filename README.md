## The chat application

To make things easy we wrote the boring parts for you.

Go grab it from chat.js

This is where you write the code

## Ready set go!

You've got the deps, you've got the code. You can run the code

for client mode call me like
`node chat.js --name=MY_NAME --port=9000 --host=10.0.1.30`

for server mode call me like
`node chat.js --name=MY_SERVER_NAME --server=MY_PORT`

You can talk to yourself in either client or server mode. If
    you run in client mode whatever host/port your trying to
    connect to should be up.
